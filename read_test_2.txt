All FLAGS registers contain the condition codes, flag bits that let the results of one machine-language
instruction affect another instruction. Arithmetic and logical instructions set some or all of the flags,
and conditional jump instructions take variable action based on the value of certain flags. For example,
jz (Jump if Zero), jc (Jump if Carry), and jo (Jump if Overflow) depend on specific flags. Other conditional
jumps test combinations of several flags.

FLAGS registers can be moved from or to the stack. This is part of the job of saving and restoring processor
context, against a routine such as an interrupt service routine whose changes to registers should not be seen
by the calling code.
